    <h2>AMD Ryzen 7 2700X 8-Core Processor</h2>
    <p class="quote">
        The AMD Ryzen 7 2700X was a great part that I chose for its performance in productivity tasks and streaming and while it's not the best processor at pure gaming tasks, its was the best overall value for the money.

    <h2>Cooler Master MasterLiquid ML240R RGB 66.7 CFM Liquid Cooler</h2>
    <p class="quote">
        For this PC Build, I was looking to buy an All-In-One (AIO) liquid cooler to cool the Processor. The 2700X comes with a stock cooler part with the packaging but it will not handle temperatures for overclocking. I wanted to overclock the 2700X and I read part reviews that stated that temperatures would increase dramatically as the frequency of the increases so to keep the temperatures down, liquid cooling was a great choice. There is also a pair of addressable RGB led fans that are included to mount to the radiator.

    <h2>ASUS ROG Crosshair VII Hero ATX AM4 Motherboard</h2>
    <p class="quote">
        The motherboard is the system that manages all of the different components of the computer. I chose the ASUS Republic of Gamers VII Hero because it has a great 12 phase power delivery system and plenty of I/O connection options, especially a total of 12 USB 3.0 ports. Also, there is programmable RGB LEDs on the board components so I can change the color through ASUS Software.

    <h2>G.Skill Trident Z RGB 16GB DDR4-3200MHz CL14 Memory</h2>
    <p class="quote">
        For the memory solution, I picked up two 8GB memory module from the G.Skill Trident Z RGB RAM. These RAM Module are Samsung B-Die which are selectively binned parts that selected out of a regular engineering batch. The Ryzen 2000 Series CPUs scale in performance with faster memory.

    <h2>Samsung 860 Evo 1TB Solid State Drive 2.5"</h2>
    <p class="quote">
        I brought the Samsung 860 Evo 1TB Solid State Drive (SSD) from reading reviews on the performance and reliability of this drive. The speed of SSDs are far greater than traditional mechanical drives (HDDs).

    <h2>XFX Radeon RX580 8GB GTS OC+ Edition</h2>
    <p class="quote">
        The Radeon RX580 is another AMD part that was picked as the Video Card Graphics solution for this build. For the price, it can handle intense gaming at a resolution of 1920x1080 (Full HD) and can play majority of games at 2560x1440 (Quad HD). Currently, the monitor I have hooked to this PC Build is a Quad HD monitor.

    <h2>Phanteks Eclipse P400S ATX Mid Tower Case</h2>
    <p class="quote">
        I picked this particular case to house the rest of the PC components due to the build quality, size, and features of the case. Majority of the case parts are made out of rolled and stamped metal that will make the case last a long time and have great durability. The case is not too big and heavy, only weighting 15.4 lbs which is pretty portable. The case also built in RGB led lighting which are used in conjunction with the other RGB lighting on the cooler fans and motherboard lights.

    <h2>EVGA SuperNOVA P2 850W 80+ Platinum Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply</h2>
    <p class="quote">
        I picked the EVGA SuperNOVA P2 Series 850W 80+ Platinum Certified power supply with fully modular components. This power supply can supply plenty of power with a 850 watt rating. It is also 80+ platinum certified which means it was tested to a standard where it requires 80% power efficiency at different loads. The platinum rating maxes out at 89% efficiency at 100% load so this power supply can supply more than enough power and is very efficient at load. It also is modular which means that call the power cables and be removed from the main power supply housing if it needs to be stored away.
